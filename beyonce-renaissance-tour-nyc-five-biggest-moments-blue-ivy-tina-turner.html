The set pieces are covered in silver, tinsel, metallic fabrics, and most of all, glitter visible from every corner of the stadium. Plus, once you see the animatronic arms framing the singer with window panes and changing the colors of her white robe, you can't really go back to a non-technological life.</p><h2 dir=ltr>The many, many dance breaks</h2><p id=eQwAZ6jyIkz data-wc=89>What makes seem like even more fun than many of the singer's previous tours is that it looks like she herself is having a blast. Apart from interacting with fans, having them address her at times as "Heyyy, Ms Carter," she got them all involved by having them clap along with her as each song kicked into high gear and she bust out the moves. And bust them out she did, as each of the interludes frequently ended with extended dance breaks for the crew and Bey herself.</p><p id=enPjDaLwEN1 data-wc=15><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Beyoncé's latest show leaves Lizzo in tears after onstage moment in emotionally charged video</a></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/efd9965b8cba-beyonce-renaissance-world-tour.jpg><p id=ehk6ItsQNoI data-wc=67>From twerking to hair flips that'll make your neck ache for days, Beyoncé tears it up when the time comes to show off her own moves. While she's always been an accomplished dancer, she goes in particularly hard this time, keeping up with her backup dancers AND singing throughout! It's giving 2013 Super Bowl Halftime Show levels of dedication, and the crowd was definitely here for it.</p><h2 dir=ltr>Blue Ivy steals the show</h2><p id=eKw7H0INab4O data-wc=42>Beyoncé may be the headlining star, but when she brought out her daughter Blue Ivy Carter in the middle of the fourth act, all the attention was momentarily on the 11-year-old and her killer moves. <strong>Watch a snippet from her performance below!</strong></p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Blue Ivy performs on stage with Beyoncé at the Renaissance Tour in NYC</figure><p id=eibGC2OJSxRF data-wc=96>Beginning with the May 26 show in Paris, <a class=hm-link href=#>Blue has made occasional appearances alongside her mother</a>, and while they're not as frequent, they've been enough to credit her as one of the official dancers. And dance she did, walking onstage alongside her mom in an identical orange and silver jersey, joining the dancers for a mash-up of 'My Power' and 'Black Parade', already quite the natural. She looked delighted to be there, but her mom felt it even more, with the stadium's jumbotrons catching her proud gaze as she watched her daughter take a final bow.</p><h2 dir=ltr>The ballroom breakdown to close the show</h2><p id=eNGn61S_k7wc data-wc=35>While the 'Single Ladies' singer ended her show with an encore of album closer 'Summer Renaissance', the true peak of the show came with the ballroom dance break for the sixth and final act's outro.</p><p id=eqdH0lqTl4 data-wc=12><strong>MORE:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Beyoncé pays emotional family tribute in the middle of her show</a></p><p id=ex2ozaBP7U1Y data-wc=47>After a performance of 'Pure/Honey', the singer left the stage for the final song, leaving it all open to her many backup dancers, veterans and rising stars of the ballroom scene, who duke it out in a battle, serving face, vogueing, splits, acrobatics, and so much more.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/125263718971-gettyimages-1499603098.jpg><p id=eSf5wEApNGck data-wc=106>In a period of time where the rights of LGBT people, particularly trans and POC communities, are under attack, Beyoncé chose to champion them with the house-inspired Renaissance. And her deep love and respect for the community is present throughout the concert, featuring several video montages that pay tribute to them, featuring scenes from their lives and clubs. The is, in many ways, a love letter to the LGBT community like the album that inspired it, and for a city with such a diverse and thriving queer population as NYC, myself included, it was the most heartfelt way to spend a Saturday night.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfmLKtscGroK2hlah8dYWXcW5uZ5KaxrC6wp5kq52elra0v8Cnmp5lpKTCs3nNsppmnpmrsm6uyKCenqukYrqwucSnq6xlkqHCpnnIr7BmrJmjrm7A1Kulnqpf</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fbeyonce-renaissance-tour-nyc-five-biggest-moments-blue-ivy-tina-turner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fbeyonce-renaissance-tour-nyc-five-biggest-moments-blue-ivy-tina-turner.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fbeyonce-renaissance-tour-nyc-five-biggest-moments-blue-ivy-tina-turner.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fbeyonce-renaissance-tour-nyc-five-biggest-moments-blue-ivy-tina-turner.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fbeyonce-renaissance-tour-nyc-five-biggest-moments-blue-ivy-tina-turner.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fbeyonce-renaissance-tour-nyc-five-biggest-moments-blue-ivy-tina-turner.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./flamenco-cheer-crossword-clue-thomas-joseph-1-answer-with-3-letters-1227158.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./flamenco-cheer-crossword-clue-thomas-joseph-1-answer-with-3-letters-1227158.html>Flamenco cheer Crossword Clue Thomas Joseph 1 Answer with 3 letters</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./paramores-hayley-williams-taylor-york-are-officially-dating.html>Paramores Hayley Williams, Taylor York Are Officially Dating</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./paramores-hayley-williams-taylor-york-are-officially-dating.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
