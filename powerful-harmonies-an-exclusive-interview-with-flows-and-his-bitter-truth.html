In this captivating conversation, we explore the creative forces behind their latest electrifying track, “Power.” Discover the inspiration that sparked this musical gem, the seamless blend of house and gospel, and how this collaboration has impacted their artistic journey. Get ready to be inspired and moved as we delve into the depths of “Power” and the powerful harmonies that define their unique sound.</h2></p><p><strong>Hi guys, welcome to CelebMix! Can you tell us about the inspiration behind your latest track “Power,” and how the collaboration with His Bitter Truth came about?</strong></p><p><b>Dave:</b> The initial idea came together really naturally. I’ve always been drawn to piano based tracks and I am very inspired by 90’s house music (and the Korg M1 sound) so I wrote the top line with these influences in mind. Generally the way Blair and I work is one person will start an idea and then send it on to develop or add additional elements. I remember when writing the top piano line and drum groove for Power I was just praying that Blair would also be into it, and luckily for us, he was! We were introduced to <a href=#>His Bitter Truth</a> through Illyus (from Illyus and&nbsp; Barrientos) and we sent over the Power instrumental along with several other ideas we had come up with and I vividly remember receiving the the track back shortly after with these stunning vocals on it and just knew it was going to be a special song and collaboration.</p><p><b>HBT:</b> With Power, I knew it had to be impactful and anthemic, and I always try to have a message in the songs I write. I was going through a hard time and the song ended up being like therapy for me. I try not to overthink the track whilst writing. It’s actually quite an outer-body experience sometimes. The music guides me through and I get a gut feeling about the lyric and melody. The word POWER popped out and felt right, and the rest wrote itself.</p><p><strong>“Power” has been described as a “life-affirming house record.” What emotions or messages were you aiming to convey through this song?</strong></p><p><b>HBT:</b> Inner-strength I guess is the overriding theme. I hope people feel empowered by it. I love music that gets you through a moment. Something you can throw on and it instantly transforms your mood. I want Power to be that euphoric track you play that makes you forget everything and makes you want to dance.</p><p><strong>As a Scottish house duo, how do you feel your hometown of Glasgow has influenced your musical style and creative process?</strong></p><p><b>Blair:</b> It’s hard not to be inspired by the incredible talent and history Glasgow has in electronic music. At times it’s a bit overwhelming just how much talent and scene there is here. We’re looking forward to getting back out around Glasgow to meet more people and hear more of what is going on.</p><p><b>Dave:</b> Glasgow in general is such a creative and inspiring City. I do think there is something about the (often) terrible weather that encourages people to get into their studio set up and make such amazing music! Growing up, I always relished going into the City and going to gigs and vividly remember the sheer varieties of musical genres on offer which has undoubtedly influenced Flows’ sound today.</p><p><strong>With previous releases on notable labels like Glasgow Underground and Superfett, how do you approach each new project to maintain a fresh and unique sound?</strong></p><p><strong>Blair</strong>: We always just make what we’re feeling at that time. We definitely love 90s house and you can hear that in this record. It’s a big piano house record, using the classic M1 synth that was used in those records. We both have such a wide taste in music, we’re always trying to draw inspiration from everything we listen to.</p><p><b>Dave:</b> I echo what Blair said, we both generally try not to listen to what is popular in the dance music charts at a particular time and instead just start an idea and see where the creative process takes us.</p><p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebmix.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/powerful-harmonies-an-exclusive-interview-with-flows-and-his-bitter-truth-02-300x300.jpg alt width=376 height=376 sizes="(max-width: 376px) 100vw, 376px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p><strong>Collaborating with His Bitter Truth, who has an impressive list of collaborations with various artists, must have been exciting. How did this collaboration impact the creative direction of “Power”?</strong></p><p><b>Blair: </b>The track was mostly complete when we sent it over to His Bitter Truth and when we got&nbsp; the vocal back, it was mind blowing. We felt the bassline in the verses needed a bit of pace added in so we went back to make it work, and went back and forth with HBT on which was best for the track.</p><p><strong>“Power” seamlessly blends the rhythms of house music with the essence of gospel. Can you share some insights into your process of combining these two genres to create a distinctive sound?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><b>HBT:</b> I don’t think about it! I mean, I don’t sit down and think, right, this track needs to be X, Y and Z. It’s a lot more organic for me. It’s a feeling. I listen to an idea or instrumental and a melody usually jumps out, which often naturally leads to a word or a phrase. The track idea then reveals itself. It’s quite hard to describe to be honest. I’ll just get a sense of what the track needs to be…in my opinion! The music Flows had created took me back to a lot of the house I loved growing up, which had a lot of big gospel vocals on it, so subliminally I guess it came out in Power too.</p><p><strong>Your music has gained support from renowned DJs and radio hosts. How do you approach crafting tracks that resonate with both underground and mainstream audiences?</strong></p><p><b>Dave: </b>I think for Blair and I the key to the creative process is having an understanding about what will work on a dancefloor but equally captivate a radio audience. We generally find that the tracks that have received the most support, like Holding On, have come together naturally and everything has clicked into place at the right moment.</p><p><strong>The track “Power” seems perfect for uplifting summer vibes. How do you envision your listeners connecting with the song, and what kind of experience do you hope they have while listening?</strong></p><p><b>Dave:</b> When I make tracks like this, I always close my eyes and imagine it being played out and for Power I could definitely imagine a summer setting with everyone throwing their hands in the air but equally this song could also soundtrack a journey work or get you through a gym session. This track is such a joy for all three of us and we just hope that people get out of it what we do.</p><p><b>HBT:</b> I hope they smile! I hope it makes them happy. I hope it makes them dance and makes them want to put their arms up in the air, go crazy and forget their trouble, for at least a moment. It still gives me goosebumps when I listen to it, so that has to be a good sign. And I do hope the lyric resonates with them too and fills them with some joy! Life is hard, and we need moments where we can just let go and breathe. I hope that Power can be that for people. Just dance…you got this.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51kvbDDxKudrqRdna6zuc6noJ6rXZa7brHXnKOuq5mrsm61za2cq66ZmsRuw8itn2aenKTEtHnAp5tmoJmoeqO1062cq2Wkp8K1tI4%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fpowerful-harmonies-an-exclusive-interview-with-flows-and-his-bitter-truth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fpowerful-harmonies-an-exclusive-interview-with-flows-and-his-bitter-truth.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fpowerful-harmonies-an-exclusive-interview-with-flows-and-his-bitter-truth.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fpowerful-harmonies-an-exclusive-interview-with-flows-and-his-bitter-truth.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fpowerful-harmonies-an-exclusive-interview-with-flows-and-his-bitter-truth.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fpowerful-harmonies-an-exclusive-interview-with-flows-and-his-bitter-truth.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./ali-larter-young-photos.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./ali-larter-young-photos.html>Ali Larter Then &amp;amp; Now: Photos Hollywood Life</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./ruba-nadda.html>Award-Winning Director, Ruba Naddackbuster Married Husband Greg Dinsmore in 1994</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./ruba-nadda.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
