Do yourself a favor." You just don’t think it. So here I am today. The ship has sailed,' she said.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jennifer - who spent ten years starring on the hit sitcom Friends, from 1994 until 2004 - admitted that she was too focused on her career to think about the fact that her future self may one day want to settle down and have children, although she hit out at the constant scrutiny she faced for not getting pregnant during her five-year marriage to Pitt.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I just cared about my career. And God forbid a woman is successful and doesn’t have a child,' she said. 'And the reason my husband left me, why we broke up and ended our marriage, was because I wouldn’t give him a kid.

about her complicated relationship with her parents. Her father, John, and her mother, Nancy, were both actors. They divorced when she was nine, which she admitted wasn't easy for her mom.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I think my mom’s divorce really screwed her up,' she said. 'Back in that generation it wasn’t like, "Go to therapy, talk to somebody. Why don’t you start microdosing?" You’re going through life and picking up your child with tears on your face and you don’t have any help.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jennifer previously revealed during a <a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>chat </a>with Sandra Bullock that she grew up 'watching adults being unkind to each other' in a 'household that was destabilized and felt unsafe.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She also told <a style=font-weight:700 rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>Elle </a>that her upbringing was 'challenging,' and recalled coming home one day to the news that her father had suddenly moved out.

'It’s toxic to have that resentment, that anger. I learned that by watching my mom never let go of it.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>'I remember saying, "Thank you for showing me what never to be." So that’s what I mean about taking the darker things that happen in our lives, the not-so-happy moments, and trying to find places to honor them because of what they have given to us.'</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Jennifer also addressed the changing landscape of Hollywood, saying she feels as though real 'movie stars' no longer exist - and suggesting that the industry doesn't have the same kind of 'fun' that it once used to, noting: 'I feel like it’s dying.
