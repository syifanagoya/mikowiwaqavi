His family owned and operated The Keeso Sawmill Company.&nbsp;</p><p>In his youth, Keeso actively engaged in the family business, spending several years working at the sawmill. However, a significant turning point occurred on September 9, 2018, when a devastating fire destroyed the sawmill.</p><p>Despite this setback, Keeso, like many boys in the closely-knit community, discovered his passion on the hockey rink.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The actor pursued a career in junior hockey, playing for the Strathroy Rockets in the WOHL, where he shared the ice with future two-time Stanley Cup champion Jeff Carter.

KEESO’ tattoo, an homage to the Sawmill company owned and operated by his father.</p><p>The J.H. KEESO business has a rich history, dating back to its founding in 1872 by Keeso’s ancestors, making the tattoo a symbol of familial legacy.&nbsp;Before embarking on his successful acting career, the actor spent a considerable portion of his life working in the mill.&nbsp;</p><p>On his left bicep, Keeso sports a tattoo of his dog. The&nbsp;Letterkenny&nbsp;actor’s love for his friend is evident as fans have witnessed them on walks and in markets. To immortalize this companionship, Keeso chose to ink his dog’s portrait on his skin.&nbsp;</p><p>Interestingly, amidst his collection of meaningful tattoos, Keeso also sports several random lines and word tattoos that may seem enigmatic to outsiders. While these may not have an obvious meaning for onlookers, they likely hold personal significance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifnJa6sMHRm6yfnl6YvK57wJyrqKpfo7yzucCnZKudlZnCtHnTmqutp5%2BofA%3D%3D</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fnorman-reedus-tattoos.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fnorman-reedus-tattoos.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fnorman-reedus-tattoos.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fnorman-reedus-tattoos.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fnorman-reedus-tattoos.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fnorman-reedus-tattoos.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./jennifer-aniston-bares-tiny-chanel-bra-discussing-infertility-struggle-html.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./jennifer-aniston-bares-tiny-chanel-bra-discussing-infertility-struggle-html.html>Jennifer Aniston bares it all in TINY Chanel bra while discussing infertility struggle</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./174953-temba-bavuma-kagiso-rabada-excluded-proteass-limited-series-india.html>Temba Bavuma and Kagiso Rabada Excluded From Proteas Limited-Overs Series Against India</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./174953-temba-bavuma-kagiso-rabada-excluded-proteass-limited-series-india.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
